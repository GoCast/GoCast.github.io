{"name":"GoCast It!","tagline":"Group collaboration using WebRTC technologies and XMPP","body":"### Welcome to GoCast\r\nWe are a small startup dedicated to small group collaboration and advancing the WebRTC cause. WebRTC is a great audio/video technology which is being integrated into browsers over time. Google started the [WebRTC](http://www.webrtc.org) project and has native support for it in Chrome version 24+. Firefox is building WebRTC natively in the May/June 2013 timeframe. And Opera is working on native support as well. Other browsers may or may not support WebRTC directly. At GoCast, we had a need - a need for WebRTC support in multiple browsers on multiple platforms in a much earlier timeframe... so we built a plugin which wraps the WebRTC framework and allows us to have access to all the great WebRTC features on Windows, Mac, and Linux(*YMMV) and currently on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and (not fully tested) IE among others who support the NSAPI plugin mechanism.\r\n\r\nWe had an open source effort in 2012 which is now being updated here in a much more organized fashion. We have a much simpler build mechanism and we have Javascript support for seamless use of the native or plugin version of WebRTC which further simplifies your life as a would-be application developer wanting peer-to-peer video and audio real-time communications. Woo hoo!\r\n\r\nWant to checkout the open source plugin yourself? Go for it.
