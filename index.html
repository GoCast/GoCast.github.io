        <h3>Welcome to GoCast</h3>

<p>We are a small startup dedicated to small group collaboration and advancing the WebRTC cause. Our company splits down the line of a commercial product around collaboration and the WebRTC core for audio and video components of that collaboration inside the confines of a web browser.</p>

<h2>Small Group Collaboration</h2>

<p>Our small group collaboration software can be found on our main site at <a href="https://study.gocast.it/subscription.html">GoCast.it</a> where you can jump into a sample room and try it out. More information about the product can also be found at the <a href="http://www.gocast.it">company website</a>. Our product utilizes standard XMPP servers in conjunction with a good amount of <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.JS</a> with custom XMPP clients acting in a number of roles which dictate client interaction, access controls and make bridges to the backend NoSQL databases on Amazon AWS.</p>

<h2>WebRTC efforts</h2>

<p>WebRTC is a great audio/video technology which is being integrated into browsers over time. Google started the <a href="http://www.webrtc.org">WebRTC</a> project and has native support for it in Chrome version 24+. Firefox is building WebRTC natively in the May/June 2013 timeframe. And Opera is working on native support as well. Other browsers may or may not support WebRTC directly. At GoCast, we had a need - a need for WebRTC support in multiple browsers on multiple platforms in a much earlier timeframe... so we built a plugin which wraps the WebRTC framework and allows us to have access to all the great WebRTC features on Windows, Mac, and Linux(*YMMV) and currently on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and (not fully tested) IE among others who support the NSAPI plugin mechanism.</p>

<p>We had an open source effort in 2012 which is now being updated here in a much more organized fashion. We have a much simpler build mechanism and we have Javascript support for seamless use of the native or plugin version of WebRTC which further simplifies your life as a would-be application developer wanting peer-to-peer video and audio real-time communications. Woo hoo!</p>
